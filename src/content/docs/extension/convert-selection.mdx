description: Generate a skill from selected text on any webpage

import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## How It Works

<Steps>

1. **Select text on any webpage**

   Highlight the text you want to turn into a skill. This could be a section of an article, a methodology description, or any content describing a process.

2. **Right-click the selection**

3. **Click "Generate Skill from Selection"**

   The context menu option appears when you have text selected.

4. **Wait for generation**

   The toolbar icon shows a spinner and elapsed time. Generation runs in the background.

5. **View your skill**

   A new tab opens with your generated skill on skillthis.ai.

</Steps>

## Requirements

- **Minimum 20 characters** of selected text is required
- If the selection is too short, you'll see a notification: "Please select more text to generate a skill"

<Aside type="tip">
  Select the most methodology-rich text you can find. Paragraphs describing specific processes, tools, and examples will produce much better skills than generic introductory text.
</Aside>

## One at a Time

Only one skill can generate at a time. If you try to generate from a selection while another generation is in progress, you'll see a notification: "Already generating a skill. Please wait."

## Selection vs. Full Page

| Method | Best For |
|---|---|
| **Full page** (popup button) | Blog posts, articles, documentation where the whole page is relevant |
| **Selection** (right-click menu) | Extracting specific sections, cherry-picking the best content, pages with mixed content |

The selection method gives you more control over what goes into the skill. If a page has great methodology buried in a longer article, select just that section.

## How the Source Is Tracked

When generating from a selection, SkillThis records:
- The **selected text** as the expertise input
- The **page URL** as the source
- The **page title** for reference

This context appears on the skill's share page.
