import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The SkillThis Chrome extension lets you generate skills directly from any webpage or selected text, without visiting skillthis.ai.

## Install from Chrome Web Store

1. Visit the [SkillThis extension on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com)
2. Click **Add to Chrome**
3. Confirm the permissions

The extension icon will appear in your Chrome toolbar.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| **activeTab** | Access the current page content when you click "Convert to Skill" |
| **contextMenus** | Add the "Generate Skill from Selection" right-click menu item |
| **scripting** | Extract text content from webpages |
| **notifications** | Show status notifications (errors, generation in progress) |

<Aside>
  The extension only accesses page content when you explicitly trigger it (clicking the button or using the right-click menu). It does not read pages in the background.
</Aside>

## What You Can Do

| Feature | How | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Convert a full page** | Click the extension icon | Extracts the main content and generates a skill |
| **Convert selected text** | Highlight text, right-click, "Generate Skill from Selection" | Uses the selected text as input |

## Visual Indicators

When generating a skill, the extension shows:

- **Spinner animation** on the toolbar icon
- **Elapsed time badge** showing how many seconds the generation has been running
- Both indicators clear automatically when generation completes

The result opens in a new tab as a share page on skillthis.ai.
