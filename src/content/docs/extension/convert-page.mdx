description: Generate a skill from an entire webpage

import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## How It Works

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to a webpage** with content you want to turn into a skill

2. **Click the SkillThis extension icon** in your Chrome toolbar

   A popup appears showing the current page title and URL.

3. **Click "Convert to Skill"**

   The extension extracts the page content and sends it to SkillThis for skill generation.

4. **Wait for generation**

   The toolbar icon shows a spinner animation and elapsed time badge. You can close the popup and continue browsing. Generation runs in the background.

5. **View your skill**

   When complete, a new tab opens with your generated skill on skillthis.ai, including the grade and full skill content.

</Steps>

## Content Extraction

The extension intelligently extracts the main content from the page:

1. Looks for content in common containers: `<article>`, `<main>`, `[role="main"]`, `.post-content`, `.article-content`, `.entry-content`
2. Falls back to `<body>` if no specific content area is found
3. Removes non-content elements: navigation, headers, footers, sidebars, ads, comments, social sharing widgets
4. Prepends the page title for additional context
5. Truncates at 15,000 characters to stay within API limits

<Aside type="caution">
  Pages with very little text content (under 50 characters after extraction) will show an error: "Could not extract enough content from this page." Try a different page or use the [selection method](/extension/convert-selection) instead.
</Aside>

## Background Generation

When you click "Convert to Skill," the generation is delegated to the extension's background service worker. This means:

- You can **close the popup** after clicking the button
- You can **continue browsing** while the skill generates
- The result **opens in a new tab** automatically when ready
- If generation fails, you'll see a **Chrome notification** with the error message

## Best Pages to Convert

The extension works best with:

- Blog posts and articles with structured content
- Documentation pages with processes and methodologies
- Tutorials with step-by-step instructions
- Professional guides with specific tools and frameworks

It works less well with:

- Pages with minimal text (image-heavy, video-only)
- Single-page applications where content is dynamically loaded
- Pages behind authentication (the extension can only access what's visible)
