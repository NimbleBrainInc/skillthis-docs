import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

These best practices are based on [Anthropic's official skill authoring guidelines](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) and apply to all skills, whether generated by SkillThis or written by hand.

## 1. Conciseness

> "The context window is a public good."

The AI is smart. Only add context it doesn't already have. Challenge every piece of content:

- "Does the AI really need this explanation?"
- "Can I assume the AI knows this?"
- "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

**Verbose (bad):**
```markdown
PDF (Portable Document Format) files are a common file format
that contains text, images, and other content. To extract text
from a PDF, you'll need to use a library...
```

**Concise (good):**
```markdown
Use pdfplumber for text extraction:
```python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```

## 2. Degrees of Freedom

Match specificity to task fragility. Not every skill should be prescriptive.

| Freedom Level | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **High** | Multiple approaches valid, context-dependent | Code review process |
| **Medium** | Preferred pattern exists, some variation okay | Report generation |
| **Low** | Operations are fragile, consistency critical | Database migrations |

High-freedom skills describe what to look for and why. Low-freedom skills specify exact steps and commands.

## 3. Description Writing

The description field in YAML frontmatter is injected into AI system prompts. Always use third person.

**Good:**
```yaml
description: Processes Excel files and generates reports. Use when working with spreadsheets or when the user mentions Excel, CSV, or data exports.
```

**Bad:**
```yaml
description: I can help you process Excel files and generate reports.
```

Always include both **what it does** and **when to use it** (trigger phrases).

## 4. Naming Conventions

Use gerund form (verb ending in -ing):

```
processing-pdfs
analyzing-spreadsheets
managing-databases
writing-documentation
reviewing-pull-requests
```

Avoid vague names (`helper`, `utils`, `tools`) and overly generic names (`documents`, `data`, `files`).

## 5. Provide Defaults, Not Options

Don't present the AI with choices. Give it the recommended approach.

**Too many options (bad):**
```markdown
You can use either PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite. For PostgreSQL,
use pg library. For MySQL, use mysql2. For SQLite, use better-sqlite3.
Each has different connection string formats...
```

**Default with escape hatch (good):**
```markdown
Use PostgreSQL with the pg library:
```javascript
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL })
```

If the project uses a different database, adapt accordingly.
```

## 6. Concrete Examples Over Abstract Descriptions

Every example should be an input/output pair.

**Abstract (bad):**
```markdown
When reviewing code, look for common issues like security
vulnerabilities and performance problems.
```

**Concrete (good):**
```markdown
**Example 1:**
Input: PR adds a new `/api/users/:id` DELETE endpoint
Output:
- Flag: No authentication check on delete operation
- Flag: Missing rate limiting
- Suggestion: Add soft-delete with `deleted_at` timestamp
```

## 7. Workflow Checklists

For complex multi-step tasks, include a checklist the AI can track:

```markdown
Copy this checklist and track your progress:

Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze the input
- [ ] Step 2: Create mapping
- [ ] Step 3: Validate
- [ ] Step 4: Execute
- [ ] Step 5: Verify output
```

This helps the AI maintain state across long interactions.

## 8. Progressive Disclosure

Keep the main skill file focused. Link to detailed reference files for advanced features:

```markdown
## Quick Start
[Immediate value code example]

## Advanced Features
**Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md)
**API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)
```

This pattern works in Claude Code where skills can reference other files in the same directory.

<Aside>
  Progressive disclosure only works with file-based skill systems like Claude Code. For ChatGPT Custom Instructions or Claude Projects, keep everything in a single document.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad |
|---|---|
| Time-sensitive information | "Before August 2025, use X" becomes stale |
| Inconsistent terminology | Using different terms for the same concept confuses the AI |
| Too many options | Decision fatigue reduces the AI's effectiveness |
| Over-explaining basics | Wastes tokens on knowledge the AI already has |
| First/second person in description | Confuses the system prompt context |
