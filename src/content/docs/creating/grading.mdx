title: Understanding Your Grade
description: How SkillThis grades skills from A+ to F and what each grade means
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Every skill generated by SkillThis receives a letter grade from A+ to F, along with a numeric score from 0 to 100. The grade reflects how effectively an AI assistant can use the skill, not the quality of your expertise.

## Grade Scale

| Grade | Score Range | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| A+ | 90-100 | Exceptional, production-ready |
| A | 85-89 | Excellent with minor room for improvement |
| A- | 80-84 | Very good, minimal issues |
| B+ | 75-79 | Good, a few areas to improve |
| B | 70-74 | Solid skill with some gaps |
| B- | 65-69 | Decent but needs work |
| C+ | 60-64 | Acceptable but notable weaknesses |
| C | 55-59 | Below average, significant gaps |
| C- | 50-54 | Weak methodology |
| D | 30-49 | Poor, mostly abstract or minimal |
| F | 0-29 | Placeholder, lacks real methodology |

<Aside>
  Grading is deliberately strict. Most skills score between 40 and 70. Only exceptional skills with concrete methodology, specific examples, and proper formatting score above 80.

## Grade Badge Colors

Each grade has a color-coded badge:

- **A grades** (A+, A, A-): <span class="grade-badge grade-a">Green</span> - Ready for production use
- **B grades** (B+, B, B-): <span class="grade-badge grade-b">Yellow-green</span> - Good with minor improvements needed
- **C grades** (C+, C, C-): <span class="grade-badge grade-c">Amber</span> - Usable but with notable gaps
- **D grade**: <span class="grade-badge grade-d">Orange</span> - Needs significant improvement
- **F grade**: <span class="grade-badge grade-f">Red</span> - Essentially a placeholder

## The Self-Critique Loop

If your skill scores below 60 on the first generation attempt, SkillThis automatically:

1. Analyzes the grading feedback
2. Regenerates the skill with improvements
3. Re-grades the improved version

This happens behind the scenes. You only see the final result. The improvement count is tracked, and the system makes one improvement attempt before showing you the result.

## Improvement Suggestions

Along with your grade, you receive 3 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement. These tell you exactly what would raise your score.

Examples of suggestions you might see:

- "Add concrete input/output examples showing what a candidate profile looks like before and after screening"
- "Replace abstract advice with specific tool configurations or commands"
- "Include a checklist for the multi-step deployment process"

## What Affects Your Grade

The grade is based on 6 weighted criteria. See [Grading Criteria](/format/grading-criteria) for the full breakdown.

| Criterion | Weight | Quick Check |
|---|---|---|
| Format Compliance | 15% | Valid YAML frontmatter, kebab-case name, third-person description |
| Conciseness | 15% | Doesn't over-explain, assumes AI is smart |
| Quick Start Quality | 15% | Immediate actionable content upfront |
| Workflow Quality | 15% | Clear step-by-step process |
| Examples Quality | 20% | Concrete input/output pairs |
| Completeness | 20% | Edge cases, pitfalls, templates, defaults |

## Common Reasons for Low Grades

| Issue | Grade Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No Quick Start section | -15 points | Lead with an immediately actionable example |
| First/second person in description | -10 points | Use third person ("Analyzes..." not "I analyze...") |
| Abstract examples | -10 points | Provide concrete input/output pairs |
| Over-explaining basics | -10 points | Remove explanations the AI already knows |
| Missing methodology | Scores 0-20 | Include actual step-by-step process |

## Improving Your Grade

The most effective way to get a higher grade: provide a more detailed input. Return to [skillthis.ai](https://skillthis.ai) and try again with:

1. More specific processes and tools
2. A concrete example walkthrough
3. Decision criteria you use
4. Edge cases you handle
