title: The Assessment Flow
description: How SkillThis evaluates your input before generating a skill
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Before generating your skill, SkillThis runs a quick assessment of your input to determine how much methodology it contains. This takes a few seconds and decides whether to generate immediately or ask follow-up questions first.

## How It Works

When you submit your expertise description, the AI evaluates it on **methodology specificity** and assigns a score from 0 to 100.

| Score Range | What It Means | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| 60-100 | Input has enough concrete methodology | Proceeds directly to skill generation |
| 0-59 | Input needs more detail | Triggers [extraction questions](/creating/extraction) |

## What the Assessment Evaluates

The assessment looks for five things:

1. **Step-by-step processes** - "First I do X, then Y"
2. **Named tools and frameworks** - Specific software, methodologies, or techniques
3. **Clear input/output examples** - What goes in, what comes out
4. **Quantifiable outcomes** - Numbers, metrics, timelines
5. **Decision trees or conditional workflows** - "If X, then Y; otherwise Z"

## The Flow

```
Input submitted
    │
    ▼
Assessment (score 0-100)
    │
    ├── Score ≥ 60 ──→ Generate skill directly
    │
    └── Score < 60 ──→ Extraction questions (3 questions)
                            │
                            ├── Answer all 3 ──→ Generate with enriched context
                            │
                            └── Skip ──→ Generate with original input
```

## What You See

When the assessment runs, you'll see a brief loading state. If your input scores below 60, the assessment also returns:

- **Reasoning** - A 1-2 sentence explanation of why your input needs more detail
- **Missing elements** - Specific suggestions for what would improve your input

This reasoning is displayed at the top of the extraction questions screen so you understand what's needed.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you already have a detailed description ready, you can skip extraction questions and generate directly. The skip option is always available.

## Assessment vs. Generation

The assessment and generation use different AI models for different purposes:

| Step | Purpose | Speed |
|---|---|---|
| Assessment | Quick check of input quality | Fast (1-2 seconds) |
| Generation | Create and grade the full skill | Slower (10-20 seconds) |

The assessment is intentionally fast so you get feedback quickly. If your input is good enough, you skip straight to generation with no delay.
