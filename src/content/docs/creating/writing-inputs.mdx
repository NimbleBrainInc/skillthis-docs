The quality of your generated skill depends directly on the quality of your input. SkillThis assesses your input on methodology specificity, scoring it from 0 to 100.

## What Makes a High-Scoring Input

The AI evaluates your input for concrete, actionable methodology. Here's what it looks for:

| Element | Example | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Step-by-step processes | "First I do X, then Y, then Z" | High |
| Named tools and frameworks | "I use the MATCH framework, LinkedIn Recruiter" | High |
| Decision trees | "If X happens, I do Y; otherwise Z" | High |
| Quantifiable outcomes | "Screened 50, interviewed 15, placed 3" | High |
| Clear input/output | "Given a job req, I produce a candidate shortlist" | Medium |
| Domain-specific vocabulary | "Boolean searches", "RICE scoring", "runbooks" | Medium |

## Scoring Tiers

### High Score (70-100)

Your input contains concrete methodology. Skills generated from these inputs typically grade B or higher.

```
I'm a technical recruiter specializing in engineering roles at
early-stage startups. My process: I source candidates through
LinkedIn boolean searches and GitHub activity, screen them with
my MATCH framework (Motivation, Aptitude, Technical depth,
Culture fit, Hunger), then guide them through the full interview
loop. I always prep candidates before each round and debrief
hiring managers after.
```

This scores high because it names specific tools (LinkedIn, GitHub), a named framework (MATCH), a clear process flow, and concrete actions.

### Medium Score (40-70)

Some methodology but incomplete. SkillThis will ask [extraction questions](/creating/extraction) to fill gaps.

```
Program manager focused on product launches. I coordinate
engineering, design, marketing, and legal. I'm good at identifying
dependencies early and keeping stakeholders aligned without
endless meetings.
```

This mentions coordination and dependencies but lacks specific tools, frameworks, or step-by-step processes.

### Low Score (0-40)

Abstract or aspirational. SkillThis will prompt you for much more detail.

```
tech recruiter, 8 years exp. i source, screen, and close
engineering candidates. good at passive outreach and salary
negotiation.
```

This lists capabilities without explaining how. No tools, no process, no examples.

## What to Include

A strong input covers at least 3 of these:

1. **Your process** - What do you do first, second, third?
2. **Your tools** - What specific software, frameworks, or techniques do you use?
3. **Your criteria** - How do you evaluate quality or make decisions?
4. **A real example** - Walk through an actual case from start to finish
5. **Your edge cases** - What do you do when things go wrong?

## What to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Why It Fails |
|---|---|---|
| Vague goals | "I design revolutionary UIs" | No methodology |
| Identity statements | "I'm a great engineer" | No process |
| Lists without depth | "Python, JavaScript, React" | Tools without workflow |
| Philosophy without action | "I believe in user-centered design" | Principles without steps |
| Too short | "marketing" | Nothing to work with |

<Aside>
  The minimum input length is 50 characters, but most high-scoring inputs are 200+ characters. Think of it as describing your process to a smart colleague who needs to replicate your work.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

### Sales Engineer

**Brief input (low score):**
```
SE at a devtools company. I do demos, POCs, and help close
technical deals. good at translating features into business value
```

**Detailed input (high score):**
```
I'm a sales engineer who runs technical demos and POCs for
enterprise SaaS deals. My approach: I never demo features, I demo
outcomes. Before any call I research the prospect's tech stack,
identify their likely pain points, and build a custom demo
environment that mirrors their setup. During the call I ask
discovery questions first, then show only the 3-4 features that
solve THEIR problems. I always leave time for hands-on exploration.
Post-demo I send a personalized follow-up with a Loom walkthrough
of their specific use case.
```

The detailed version names specific techniques (custom demo environments, discovery questions, Loom walkthroughs), describes a clear process (research, build, present, follow up), and includes decision criteria (only show features that solve their problems).
