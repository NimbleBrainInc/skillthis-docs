title: Extraction Questions
description: Guided questions that help capture your methodology when your input needs more detail

When your input scores below 60 on the [assessment](/creating/assessment), SkillThis presents three targeted questions to capture the concrete details that make a skill effective.

## The Three Questions

### Question 1: Your Process

> **Walk me through your step-by-step process.**
> *What do you do first, second, third when working on this?*

This captures the sequential workflow that forms the backbone of your skill.

**Example answer:**
```
First I analyze the requirements, then I research comparable
solutions, next I create an initial draft with placeholder
content, review it against our style guide, iterate based on
stakeholder feedback, and finalize with a quality check.
```

### Question 2: Your Tools

> **What specific tools, frameworks, or techniques do you use?**
> *Name the actual things you work with.*

This captures the named tools and frameworks that make your methodology concrete and actionable.

**Example answer:**
```
I use the MATCH framework for screening, LinkedIn Recruiter for
sourcing, and Greenhouse for tracking. For boolean searches I use
specific operators like (AND, OR, NOT) combined with site-specific
search. I track all interactions in a custom Notion database.
```

### Question 3: A Real Example

> **Describe a real example: input, process, output.**
> *Walk through an actual case from start to finish.*

This gives the AI a concrete case study to model the skill's examples section after.

**Example answer:**
```
A startup needed a senior engineer. I sourced 50 candidates through
LinkedIn and GitHub, screened 15 using MATCH criteria, and presented
5 to the hiring manager. After 3 rounds of interviews, we made 2
offers and one accepted. The hire started in 6 weeks from kickoff.
```

## Requirements

- Each answer must be at least **30 characters** long
- You can navigate back and forth between questions
- Progress is shown with a step indicator (Question 1 of 3, etc.)

## Skipping Extraction

You can skip the extraction flow entirely using the **Skip** button. If you skip:

- Your original input is used as-is for skill generation
- The skill will likely receive a lower grade since the input lacks detail
- You can always try again with a more detailed input

<Aside type="tip">
  Taking 2-3 minutes to answer the extraction questions almost always results in a significantly better skill. The questions are designed to pull out exactly what the AI needs.

## How Answers Are Used

Your three answers are combined with your original input into an enriched context:

```
[Your original input]

## Additional Context

### Step-by-Step Process
[Your answer to question 1]

### Tools & Techniques
[Your answer to question 2]

### Real Example
[Your answer to question 3]
```

This enriched context is then sent to the skill generator, which has much more material to work with than the original input alone.
