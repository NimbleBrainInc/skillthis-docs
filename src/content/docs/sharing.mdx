Every skill you generate can be shared with a unique URL. No account needed, no sign-up required.

## Share Pages

When you share a skill, it gets a permanent URL:

```
https://skillthis.ai/s/abc123
```

Share pages display:
- Your **original input** (what you described)
- The **grade badge** with letter grade and score
- The **full skill content** with syntax highlighting
- A **copy button** to grab the skill
- **Platform deployment instructions** for ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor

Anyone with the link can view and copy the skill.

## How to Share

After your skill is generated, click the **Share** button to open the share modal. You can:

| Method | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **Copy Link** | Copies the share URL to your clipboard |
| **Twitter/X** | Opens a tweet composer with your skill name and grade |
| **LinkedIn** | Opens a LinkedIn share dialog with the link |
| **Email** | Opens your email client with a pre-filled message |

## Open Graph Images

Every shared skill automatically generates an Open Graph (OG) image that appears when the link is previewed on social media, Slack, or messaging apps.

The OG image shows:
- The skill name
- The grade badge (letter and score)
- SkillThis branding

This means when you paste a `skillthis.ai/s/...` link on Twitter, LinkedIn, or Slack, it shows a rich preview card instead of a plain URL.

<Aside type="tip">
  Sharing your skill on social media with the auto-generated preview card is a great way to showcase your professional expertise. The grade badge adds a gamification element that encourages engagement.

- **Deploy instructions** - Step-by-step guides for ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor
- **Email capture** - Option to subscribe for updates about SkillThis
