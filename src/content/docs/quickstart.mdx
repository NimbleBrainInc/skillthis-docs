## Create Your First Skill

<Steps>

1. **Go to [skillthis.ai](https://skillthis.ai)**

2. **Describe your expertise**

   Write at least 50 characters describing what you do and how you do it. The more specific, the better your grade.

   ```
   I'm a technical recruiter specializing in engineering roles at
   early-stage startups. My process: I source candidates through
   LinkedIn boolean searches and GitHub activity, screen them with
   my MATCH framework (Motivation, Aptitude, Technical depth,
   Culture fit, Hunger), then guide them through the full interview
   loop. I always prep candidates before each round and debrief
   hiring managers after.
   ```

3. **Answer extraction questions (if prompted)**

   If your input needs more detail, you'll see 3 quick questions about your process, tools, and a real example. These help the AI capture your actual methodology.

4. **Review your graded skill**

   You'll see your generated skill with a letter grade (A+ through F) and specific improvement suggestions.

5. **Copy and deploy**

   Use the copy button to grab your skill, then paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or your IDE.

</Steps>

<Aside>
  The more concrete your input (specific processes, named tools, real examples), the higher your grade. See [Writing Great Inputs](/creating/writing-inputs) for detailed guidance.

## What You'll Get

A skill file that looks like this:

```yaml
---

description: Screens and evaluates engineering candidates using the MATCH framework. Use when sourcing, screening, or evaluating technical candidates for startup roles.
---
```

Followed by structured markdown with Quick Start, Workflow, Examples, Best Practices, and Common Pitfalls sections.
