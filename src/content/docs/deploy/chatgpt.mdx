## Deploy to ChatGPT

<Steps>

1. **Copy your skill** using the copy button on the SkillThis results page

2. **Open ChatGPT** and go to **Personalization** settings

3. **Paste into "Custom Instructions"**

   Paste the full skill content into the Custom Instructions field.

4. **Save and start a new chat**

   ChatGPT will apply your skill's methodology in new conversations.

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  ChatGPT has a character limit on Custom Instructions. If your skill is very long, you may need to trim it. Focus on keeping the Quick Start, Workflow, and key Examples sections.
</Aside>

## Tips for ChatGPT

- **Invoke explicitly:** Start your message with "Using [skill-name]..." to trigger the skill
- **New conversations:** Custom Instructions apply to all new chats, so you don't need to re-paste
- **Multiple skills:** If you need multiple skills, combine them into one Custom Instructions block or switch between them as needed
