## Deploy to Claude Projects

<Steps>

1. **Copy your skill** using the copy button on the SkillThis results page

2. **Start a new Project in Claude** at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)

3. **Add the skill to Project Instructions**

   Open your project settings and paste the full skill content into the Project Instructions field.

4. **Start chatting with your enhanced Claude**

   Claude will now apply your skill's methodology when relevant to the conversation.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Start your message with "Using [skill-name]..." to explicitly invoke the skill. For example: "Using recruiting-engineering-talent, screen this candidate profile."

## Claude Code (IDE)

If you're using Claude Code, you can install skills directly into your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/your-skill-name
```

Paste your skill content into `.claude/skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md`.

Claude Code automatically loads skills from the `.claude/skills/` directory when it starts. The skill's description and trigger phrases tell Claude when to apply it.

## How Claude Uses Skills

When you add a skill to Claude:

- The **description** helps Claude identify when the skill is relevant
- The **Quick Start** gives Claude the immediate approach to follow
- The **Workflow** provides the step-by-step process
- The **Examples** show Claude what good output looks like
- Claude applies the skill's methodology instead of giving generic responses
