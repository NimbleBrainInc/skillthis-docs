## Invoking Your Skill

The simplest way to activate a skill is to reference it explicitly in your message:

```
Using recruiting-engineering-talent, screen this candidate profile
for a senior backend engineer role.
```

Most AI assistants will recognize the skill name and apply the associated methodology.

## Iterating on Your Skill

Skills generated by SkillThis are starting points. To refine:

1. **Test it** - Use the skill in a real conversation and see how the AI performs
2. **Identify gaps** - Note where the AI gives generic responses instead of following your process
3. **Regenerate** - Return to [skillthis.ai](https://skillthis.ai) with a more detailed description
4. **Edit manually** - Copy the generated skill and modify it directly. Add examples, remove sections that don't apply, adjust the workflow

<Aside type="tip">
  The generated skill is plain markdown. You own it. Edit freely to match your exact needs.

## Combining Multiple Skills

If you work across multiple domains, you can use multiple skills:

- **Claude Projects:** Add multiple skills to different projects, or combine related skills in one project's instructions
- **Claude Code:** Place each skill in its own directory under `.claude/skills/`. Claude automatically picks the right one based on context.
- **ChatGPT:** Combine skills in Custom Instructions, or switch between them by updating the instructions
- **Cursor:** Combine multiple skill contents in your `.cursorrules` file with clear section headers

## Platform-Specific Tips

### Claude

- Claude respects the YAML frontmatter and uses the description to determine relevance
- Long skills work well in Claude Projects (generous context)
- For Claude Code, the skill is loaded at startup and persists across the session

### ChatGPT

- Custom Instructions have a character limit, so prioritize the most important sections
- Skills apply to all new conversations once set
- Consider keeping only Quick Start, Workflow, and key Examples if you hit the limit

### Cursor / IDE

- Skills loaded from project files apply to all AI interactions within that project
- Project-specific skills are ideal (e.g., a code review skill for your codebase)
- You can version control your skills alongside your code

## Getting More from Your Skills

### Be Specific in Requests

Instead of:
```
Review this code
```

Try:
```
Using reviewing-code-security, review this authentication
endpoint. Focus on the session management and JWT handling.
```

### Provide Context

Skills work best when the AI has both the methodology (from the skill) and the specifics (from your message):

```
Using managing-product-launches, create a launch checklist for
our new billing feature. We're targeting March 1, need legal
review for EU compliance, and the marketing team needs 2 weeks
lead time for the announcement.
```

### Give Feedback

If the AI doesn't follow your skill's methodology, tell it:

```
You're not following the MATCH framework from the skill. Please
re-evaluate this candidate using all 5 dimensions: Motivation,
Aptitude, Technical depth, Culture fit, and Hunger.
```
