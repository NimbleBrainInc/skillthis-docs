## Deploy to Your IDE

<Steps>

1. **Copy your skill** using the copy button on the SkillThis results page

2. **Create the appropriate file in your project root**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Claude Code">
       ```bash
       mkdir -p .claude/skills/your-skill-name
       ```
       Create `.claude/skills/your-skill-name/SKILL.md` and paste your skill content.
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Cursor">
       Create `.cursorrules` in your project root and paste your skill content.
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. **Start coding**

   The AI will automatically use this context when working in your project.

</Steps>

## How It Works

AI-powered IDEs load instruction files from your project directory. When you ask the AI for help, it reads these files and applies the methodology described in your skill.

- **Claude Code** reads from `.claude/skills/` (one skill per directory)
- **Cursor** reads from `.cursorrules` (single file)
- **Other IDEs** typically support similar project-level instruction files

<Aside type="tip">
  For Claude Code, you can have multiple skills in separate directories under `.claude/skills/`. Each skill is activated based on its description and trigger phrases.

## IDE-Specific Tips

### Claude Code

Claude Code supports the full skill format including YAML frontmatter. The `name` and `description` fields help Claude decide when to apply each skill.

```
your-project/
└── .claude/
    └── skills/
        ├── code-reviewer/
        │   └── SKILL.md
        └── api-designer/
            └── SKILL.md
```

### Cursor

Cursor reads `.cursorrules` as a single instruction file. If you have multiple skills, combine them into one file with clear section headers.

```
your-project/
└── .cursorrules
```
