title: YAML Frontmatter
description: Reference for the name and description fields in skill frontmatter
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The YAML frontmatter sits between `---` markers at the very top of the skill file. It contains two required fields: `name` and `description`.

```yaml
---
name: analyzing-sales-data
description: Analyzes sales pipeline data and generates forecasts. Use when reviewing quarterly numbers, building projections, or identifying pipeline risks.
---
```

## The `name` Field

### Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Format | Kebab-case (lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only) |
| Style | Gerund form preferred (verb ending in -ing) |
| Length | Maximum 64 characters |
| Pattern | Must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` |

### Good Names

```
recruiting-engineering-talent
analyzing-sales-data
reviewing-code-security
writing-technical-docs
managing-infrastructure
processing-customer-feedback
```

### Bad Names

| Name | Problem |
|---|---|
| `helper` | Too vague |
| `MySkill` | Not kebab-case |
| `code_review` | Underscores, not a gerund |
| `data` | Too generic |
| `the-ultimate-sales-methodology-v2` | Unnecessarily long |

<Aside type="tip">
  Think of the name as a filename. It should tell you what the skill does at a glance: `reviewing-pull-requests`, `writing-api-specs`, `debugging-performance`.
</Aside>

## The `description` Field

### Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Person | Must be third person |
| Content | What it does AND when to use it |
| Length | Maximum 1,024 characters |

### Why Third Person?

The description gets injected into AI system prompts. First or second person creates confusion about who is speaking.

**Good (third person):**
```yaml
description: Analyzes sales pipeline data and generates forecasts. Use when reviewing quarterly numbers, building projections, or identifying pipeline risks.
```

**Bad (first person):**
```yaml
description: I analyze sales data and help you build forecasts.
```

**Bad (second person):**
```yaml
description: You can use this to analyze your sales pipeline data.
```

### Include Trigger Phrases

The description should tell AI assistants when to activate the skill. Include "Use when..." followed by specific scenarios.

```yaml
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities and performance issues. Use when reviewing pull requests, auditing codebases, or checking for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
```

This helps the AI match user requests to the right skill.

### Description Pattern

Follow this pattern: **[What it does]. Use when [specific triggers].**

```yaml
# Pattern
description: [Verb]s [object] [how/with what]. Use when [trigger 1], [trigger 2], or [trigger 3].

# Examples
description: Writes technical documentation following the Divio framework. Use when creating API docs, writing tutorials, or structuring reference guides.

description: Manages Kubernetes deployments with rollback safety. Use when deploying to production, scaling services, or troubleshooting pod failures.

description: Conducts structured code reviews focusing on bugs and security. Use when reviewing pull requests, auditing code, or checking for vulnerabilities.
```

## Grading Impact

Frontmatter issues directly affect your grade under the **Format Compliance** criterion (15% of total score):

| Issue | Penalty |
|---|---|
| First/second person in description | -10 points |
| Missing trigger phrases | Score reduced |
| Name not in gerund form | Minor deduction |
| Name not kebab-case | Major deduction |
| Missing frontmatter entirely | Fails format compliance |
