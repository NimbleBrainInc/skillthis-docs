SkillThis is a free tool that transforms your professional expertise into structured skills that AI assistants can use. Describe what you do, and AI generates a skill file that makes ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor perform like a domain expert.

```
You: "I'm a technical recruiter who screens candidates using the
     MATCH framework and sources through LinkedIn boolean searches..."

SkillThis: Generates a structured skill, grades it B+ (78/100),
           and gives you a shareable link.
```

No account required. No cost. Just paste your expertise and go.

## How It Works

1. **Describe your expertise** in plain text (minimum 50 characters)
2. **AI assesses your input** and may ask follow-up questions to capture your methodology
3. **A skill is generated** in a structured format with YAML frontmatter and markdown
4. **The skill is graded** A+ through F on clarity, specificity, and actionability
5. **Copy, share, or deploy** to any AI platform

## What is a "Skill"?

A skill is a structured markdown document that teaches an AI assistant how to think about a specific domain. It includes:

- **YAML frontmatter** with a name and description (metadata for the AI)
- **Quick Start** section for immediate value
- **Workflow** with step-by-step processes
- **Examples** with concrete input/output pairs
- **Best Practices** and **Common Pitfalls**

Skills turn generalist AI assistants into specialists. Instead of getting generic advice, you get responses that follow your actual methodology.

## Who Is This For?

Anyone with professional expertise they want to encode into AI. SkillThis works for:

- **Engineers** encoding code review processes, architecture patterns, debugging workflows
- **Recruiters** capturing sourcing strategies, screening frameworks, interview processes
- **Product Managers** documenting prioritization methods, spec writing approaches
- **Designers** formalizing design systems, research processes, usability testing
- **Analysts** packaging data analysis workflows, reporting templates
- **Anyone** with a repeatable professional process
